        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p> Born and raised in the New England portion of the United States, I spent my 20s studying and living in New York City where I was a Project Manager in the Art Logistics field for 10 years. <br>
        I worked with galleries, museums and private collectors on managing their art collections before settling down to start my family. <br> 
        Now I am living in New Jersey and studying to become a web developer through Coding Temple's online program.</p>
